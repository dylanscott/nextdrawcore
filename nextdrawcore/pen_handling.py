pen_handling.py

Classes for managing NextDraw pen vertical motion and status, plus keeping track
of overall XYZ pen position.

Part of the NextDraw driver software
http://bantamtools.com

The classes defined by this module are:

* PenPosition: Data storage class to hold XYZ pen position

* PenHandler: Main class for managing pen lifting, lowering, and status

* PenHeight: Manage pen-down height settings and keep timing up to date

* PenLiftTiming: Class to calculate and store pen lift timing settings

* PenStatus: Data storage class for pen lift status variables

        '''
        Utility function, used for setting or updating the various parameters that control
        the pen-lift servo motor. 

        Actions:
        1. If current pen up/down state is not yet known, query EBB to see if it has
            been initialized, or whether it is still in its default power-on state.
        2. Send EBB commands to set servo positions, lifting/lowering speeds,
            PWM channel count, timeout, and standard or narrow-band servo output.
        3. Put the servo into a known/desired state, if necessary,
            by sending a pen-lift or pen-lower command. 

        Methods:
        When the EBB is reset, it goes to its default "pen up" position. The EBB may
        will tell us that the in the pen-up state. However, its actual position is the
        default, not the pen-up position that we've requested.

        To fix this, we could manually command the pen to either the pen-up or pen-down
        position. HOWEVER, that may take as much as five seconds in the very slowest
        speeds, and we want to skip that delay if the pen is already in the right place,
        for example if we're plotting after raising the pen, or plotting twice in a row.

        Solution: Store pen-up/pen-down config in EBB firmware variables that are set to
        zero upon reset.

        For changes after initialization, we use a list that encodes the pen-up, pen-down and
        narrow-band settings. If (e.g.,) the pen-down height has changed while the pen is down,
        (e.g., Python interactive API update()), move to the new position.
